## How to setup the environment in your local machine.
- Clone the repository in a directory.
- Install the modules and dependancies present in 'package.json' file in the same root directory. 
- Configure the connection with your localhost database server in 'db.js' file.
- Create new database and tables according to the skeleton written in 'db_commands.sql' file.
- Go to this directory in your terminal and type: nodemon app.js.
- Open localhost:3000 and you will see the app up and running.

Once the skeleton of the database is created, you will need to signup from the app and continue testing it with various routes.
